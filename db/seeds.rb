# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# categories = Category.create([
#     { name: 'Fashion', code: 'fashion', active: true},
#     { name: 'Mobiles and Tablets', code: 'mobile_and_tablet', active: true},
#     { name: 'Consumer Electronics', code: 'consumer_electronics', active: true},
#     { name: 'Books', code: 'books', active: true},
